# To just this extension either copy the 'sinclude' line and the setting of
# libpng_automake_extensions into contrib/extensions.am or link/copy the whole
# file there.  Do the same with the associated file extensions.am
#
# Include the ARM NEON extension:
sinclude([contrib/neon/neon.ac])
#
# If any of the extensions require automake support (this is likely) automake
# must include the file contrib/extensions.am
