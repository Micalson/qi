the libraries in this folder are manually built from the max sdk sample folder:
open the solution in maxsdk\samples with the proper Visual Studio
  see http://knowledge.autodesk.com/search-result/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2015/ENU/Max-SDK/files/GUID-6E179A56-5552-4D0B-BA61-BBD37B9E52DB-htm.html

Then build modifiers\morpher\morpher Release and copy the .lib into this folder with the corresponding name.
for example:
maxsdk\samples\modifiers\morpher\x64\Release -->  morpher_2011_x64.lib
