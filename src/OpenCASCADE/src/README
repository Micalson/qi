               Open CASCADE Technology source repository
               -----------------------------------------

This directory contains sources of Open CASCADE Technology (OCCT), a collection
of C++ libraries providing services for 3D surface and solid modeling, CAD data
exchange, and visualization. OCCT can be best applied in development of
software dealing with 3D modeling (CAD), manufacturing / measuring (CAM) or
numerical simulation (CAE).

The OCCT code is subject to the Open CASCADE Technology Public License Version
6.5 (the "License"). You may not use the content of the relevant files except in
compliance with the License. Please see the LICENSE file or obtain a copy of the
License at http://www.opencascade.org and read it completely before using this
software.

In order to build OCCT libraries from these sources for use in your program, 
you need to:

1. Download, build, and install the required third-party libraries.

   Follow the instructions provided in the documents titled "Building 3rd party
   products for OCCT" on http://dev.opencascade.org/?q=home/resources for
   installation and building.

2. Install and configure WOK development environment.

   See http://dev.opencascade.org/?q=home/resources for the latest build of the 
   WOK and instructions of configuring it.

3. Use WOK to generate build scripts or project files for your compiler,
   then build the libraries.

Note that you may use also the pre-processed source packages that include
makefiles and projects, or binary packages, available for official releases of
OCCT at http://www.opencascade.org. In this case however you will not be able
to re-generate derived files after changing the CDL files (requires WOK).

The current version of OCCT can be consulted in the file
src/Standard/Standard_Version.hxx

For more information regarding OCCT code development please consult the official
OCCT Collaborative Development Portal:

Notice:
Please read carefully doc/Overview , Building Modules chapter for 3rdparty products and Open CASCADE building instructions.
